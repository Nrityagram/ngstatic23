                  <p>
                    Nirupama Menon Rao was all of 12 when she decided that her life’s mission was to join the Indian
                    Foreign Service and become a diplomat. That early clarity of vision blossomed into a spectacular
                    career that saw her serve as India’s Foreign Secretary from 2009-2011 and India’s Ambassador to the
                    United States, China, and Sri Lanka. Throughout her journey, negotiating corridors of power, she has
                    been a strong advocate of dialogue and communication.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Her quest to seek harmony between countries and people continued after she retired from active
                    service, and led her to rediscover her other love, music. In 2017, she released an album, ‘Peace is
                    my dream’.

                  <p>
                    She has penned a book of poetry ‘Rain Rising’ that has been translated into different languages,

              her serve as India’s Foreign Secretary from 2009-2011 and India’s Ambassador to the United States, China,
              and Sri Lanka. Throughout her journey, negotiating corridors of power, she has been a strong advocate of

                    Lavanya Sankaran, author and patron of the arts, divides her time between Bangalore and New York,
                    and depending on which side of the ocean life steers her, she finds comfort in idlis and Mysore
                    coffee or jazz and bourbon. And home for her means libraries and golden retrievers.

                  <p>
                    For Lavanya writing was always a constant in her life, as both medium and muse. Since she was a
                    child, she wrote. Investment banking was a short detour, after which she again went back to her
                    first love, writing.

                  <p>
                    She is the author of the internationally acclaimed short story collection ‘The Red Carpet’, which
                    was selected for Poets and Writers Magazine’s Best First Fiction award, as well as the Barnes and
                    Noble Discover Great New Writers award. Her debut novel The Hope Factory, hit the Number 1 spot on
                    Amazon India and was also selected by Amazon UK as a Top Pick.

                  <p>
                    Lavanya’s writing is published in over 15 countries and her opinion pieces and fiction have appeared
                    in The New York Times, The Guardian and The Atlantic, among others.

                    Nitin Pujar is a keen student of the human condition. Insatiably curious, he watches people to study
                    their motivations and behavior and is a keen problem solver. Adhering to the words of the bard,
                    Nitin ‘finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks’, and so he converses with everyone,
                    whether they are young or old. Keen to experience life in its infinite variety, he travels
                    constantly, and tries to capture the ephemeral in his poetry.

                  <p>
                    Nitin’s abiding interest in studying people led him to create MACRO (Market Analysis & Consumer

                    MAVEN Advisors, a strategy Advisory Practice based in Mumbai. He has worked on strategy, sales

              Lavanya Sankaran, author and patron of the arts, divides her time between Bangalore and New York, and
              depending on which side of the ocean life steers her, she finds comfort in idlis and Mysore coffee or jazz
              and bourbon. And home for her means libraries and golden retrievers.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Lavanya writing was always a constant in her life, as both medium and muse. Since she was a child, she
              wrote. Investment banking was a short detour, after which she again went back to her first love, writing.
            </p>
            <p>
              She is the author of the internationally acclaimed short story collection ‘The Red Carpet’, which was
              selected for Poets and Writers Magazine’s Best First Fiction award, as well as the Barnes and Noble
              Discover Great New Writers award. Her debut novel The Hope Factory, hit the Number 1 spot on Amazon India
              and was also selected by Amazon UK as a Top Pick.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lavanya’s writing is published in over 15 countries and her opinion pieces and fiction have appeared in
              The New York Times, The Guardian and The Atlantic, among others.
